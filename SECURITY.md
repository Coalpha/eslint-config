# Security

*The emotional type, not the software type*

Close eyes and press hands on ears.
If you can't see any security issues and you can't hear any, everything must be going great!

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find something wrong with this, open a new issue on this repository.
I promise to respond every single one of them.

If you open a pull request that's actually just complaints, I'm going to flense you.
