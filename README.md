### An eslint config for people who think they know what they're doing

My personal eslint config for personal files
Since this config extends eslint:recommended, there's no need to include some things.
There's a lot of dependence on what eslint decides is default.
At some point I may need to update this if eslint changes defaults.
If you think this looks a lot like airbnb's eslint config, you'd be right. I like their config a lot.
